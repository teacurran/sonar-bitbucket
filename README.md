# SonarQube BitBucket Plugin

This is a fork of the SonarQube GitHub Plugin to offer the same functionality to BitBucket.

I have started with the source for SonarQube GitHub Plugin and will be changing the API calls to call BitBucket.

# This plugin does not currently work! Don't even try to use it.
